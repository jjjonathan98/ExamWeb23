Exam in Webutvikling (Web development) 3rd semester, Grade: A

Here´s how you open the files correctly:

1. Download folder as a Zip-file from GitHub.
2. Unzip and save folder on your computer.
3. Open either the "f1" folder or the "f1API" folder with Visual Studio Code.
4. Once the folder is open, right-click outside the folder in VSCode, and select "Add Folder to Workspace...", then add the folder you haven´t opened yet.
5. Now when you have both folders in a joint "Workspace", open the terminal for the "f1API" and type "dotnet run". This has to be done before the "f1" folder in order to work.
6. Now, open a terminal for the "f1" folder, and type "npm install". Once the download is complete, type "npm run dev" and click the link provided in the terminal.
7. Enjoy our solution to the exam :)
